## What
Project design as an example for first year student at AI institut as part of the algotithm class.

## Why
This project has multiple goals :
* Learn to use/create classes in python
* Get familiar to github
* Get familiar with a coding style (Simplify Pep8)
* Apply some problem solving techniques
* Have fun with pygame (because they hate me for the algo on paper part of the class =( )

## How
The student project is a runner game. This is just an example of a mini game inspired on (the wonderfull) [Crystal Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Quest) .
The mandatory part is to make a working one. So you need to have a hero, obstacles and the possibility to loose.
This, along with a little report, cannot give more than a 10/20 mark.
The student needs to create and document bonuses (like a menu, sound, own graphics, progressive difficulty, multi-player etc ...) anything you can think about. Those will get you a good mark.
A coding style based on pep8 has been shared and each error will gives you -1 to your final grade.
